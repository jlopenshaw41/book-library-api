## General info

This book library REST API project consists of a MySQL relational database, with tables containing information about library users (readers), books and lenders, and a REST API for interacting with the database to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. The API itself has been built using Express and it uses the Sequelize Object Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the MySQL database.

Using the API, the user can send HTTP requests to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions on the book library database.

The API was created using Test Driven Development methodology, using Mocha, Chai and Supertest for automated testing. Postman was also used for testing during development, in conjunction with MySQL Workbench.

In addition, Docker was used as a system-agnostic environment in which to create and run the MySQL database locally. Dotenv was used to handle the environment variables and Nodemon was used during development as a useful tool to refresh the app after making changes to the Express app.
